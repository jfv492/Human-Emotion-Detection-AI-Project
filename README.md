## Project Idea 
This project aims to create a user-friendly application for accurately identifying and managing six different types of emotions: anger, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise. Additionally, the app offers personalized recommendations, including meditation practices and nearby dining options, to help users enhance their emotional well-being. This innovative approach aims to empower individuals to proactively improve their mental health and emotional resilience across a spectrum of emotions.
