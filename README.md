# Human-Emotion-Detection-AI-Project

<h3>Project Introduction <h3> 
Emotions are a key aspect in every person's life. The emotions of an individual can depict on how they are feeling and in what manner they should be approached. But sometimes it is very difficult to assume what kind of emotions an individual might be experiencing. Human Emotion Detection, with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged to be a better tool when it comes to face recognition. Facial recognition has grown rapidly over the years. For example: the primary means of unlocking your smartphone and many other security measures, as it is very tricky to interpret someone’s facial features. Human emotion detection has been helping in many industries, the primary being medical. A lot of psychiatrists have been trying to develop better modules and advance detection of emotion with the help of AI. But not a lot of technologies are available that can detect emotions accurately and in most cases doctors do not have tools to record the data to show the statistics. 

<h3> Scope <h3>

For this project, the aim will be to record all the emotions through a period of time (E.g. when the user opens the application) and then the neural network will plot a graph showing the statistics of an individual of what kind of emotions an individual experiences in that particular duration. The data collected over time will show the patterns for doctors to study that particular individual. The process will start with extracting the face features, the common features being Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise. In this project, the following will be included in the scope:
